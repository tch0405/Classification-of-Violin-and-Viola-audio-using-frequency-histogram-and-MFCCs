# Classification-of-Violin-and-Viola-audio-using-frequency-histogram-and-MFCCs
Violin and Viola repertoires ranging from Baroque era to Classical have been used as dataset. Unprecedented adopted feature, namely frequency histogram has been used to perform classfication of violin and viola sounds which is due to the range of notes of Violin is higher. Likewise, Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients are extracted to perform comparison of results with frequency histogram. MFCCs are merely workable on solo pieces.

Repertoires with piano accompaniment had been processed manually via [Riffstation](https://www.filehorse.com/download-riffstation/) so as to reduce the amplitude of piano sound in order to facilitate the feature extraction task.
